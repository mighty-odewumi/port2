###### New Portfolio Website.

This repo contains files for my new portfolio website and 
I will still continue to update my github with more repos containing 
more portfolio website redesigns. 

Hosted on github at `mighty-odewumi.github.io/port2`.

Created with HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript. And with help
from **DesignCourse** on YouTube which helped me apply new concepts in web 
designing like whitespaces, making this very responsive on different screen sizes, and also the JS code I used for the mobile 
view.
